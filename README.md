# Otto Books 10k Apart 2016 Contest Entry
This is my 10k Apart 2016 contest entry. Otto Books is a simple streaming audio book player powered by Librivox.org

The app uses [Librivox.org's public web APIs](https://librivox.org/api/info#dev_notes).
Librivox.org has thousands of public domain books that volunteers read and recorded for public domain.
